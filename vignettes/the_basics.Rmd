Have you ever wanted to include some form of highlighting, either conditional or nonconditional, to a html document? If so, this package may be worthwhile to you. The `highlightHTML` package inject CSS into the HTML document automatically via ids (more information on CSS ids here: <http://www.cssbasics.com/css-ids/>). 

# Basic Example
Suppose you have a table like the following:

| Color Name | Number       |
|----------- | ------------ |
| Blue       |  5           |
| Green      |  35          |
| Orange     |  100         |
| Red        |  200         |
